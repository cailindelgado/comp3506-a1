We used two state-of-the-art large neural models to implement these
solutions.

(1) Vlad4-leet: A 100b neural model pretrained in Russian mathematics literature and bioinformatics textbooks.

(2) Joel-base: A 98b neural model; known bias towards cringe millenial jokes and memes.


Note: We often write both 'pythonic' and '3506-style' solutions. We have left a
couple of the pythonic ones in comments.

This code was also cleaned up, so if you find bugs, please ping us! But, overall,
the ideas should be correct, and hopefully valuable!
